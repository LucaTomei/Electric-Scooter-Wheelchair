# With this module you can easily encode or decode Xiaomi-Ninebot firmware files or make ZIP archives
# It takes as input the binary file sniffed by the Ninebot / Xiaomi application and returns the 
# decrypted file for the subsequent modification of the parameters.

# We can use the same module to encrypt the previously modified and decrypted file
